# Template for providers.yaml
#
# You can add any OpenAI API compatible provider to the "providers" list.
# For each provider you must also specify a list of models, along with model abilities.
#
# All fields are required unless marked as optional.
#
# Refer to your provider's API documentation for specific
# details such as model identifiers, capabilities etc
#
# Note: Since the OpenAI API is not a standard we can't guarantee that all
# providers will work correctly with Raycast AI.
#
# To use this template rename as `providers.yaml`
#
